name: rollback deployment

# if fly's health check works as expected , we dont need this workflow 
# as it stucks in the deployment in CI stage until timeout 
# in case health check does not work as expected, and with faulty endpoint deployment gets done
# the monitor deployment in pipeline will send a get request to dummy endpoint 
# then if the responds is anything but HTTP 200 it exits with status code 1 
# which triggers this workflow to run
# this workflow results in error - in case of execution having the unhealthy endpoint - 
# but it update the app to the working state (e.g. check the /dummy/health enfpoint )
