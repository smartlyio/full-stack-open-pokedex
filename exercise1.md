## Exercise 11.1 Warming up

I decided to assume the app is coded with Java since I’m already familiar with it. Checkstyle is a tool used to review Java code and I suppose it can be called a linter. Tests could be written using Junit whereas building can be done using Gradle. If I’m not mistaken, all this can be done using Github Actions.
	Im not exactly familiar with any other CI options than Github Actions. However I know that GitLab and CircleCI can also be used for this.
	Since the application is being coded by a relatively small team of developers, it is most likely a small/medium-size project. As mentioned in the text, this usually indicates that a cloud-based environment is optimal because of less configuration and lower expenses. Because we lack this information, we can’t be sure about it.
