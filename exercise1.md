During the Devops with docker mooc course, I expanded my CI/CD pipeline for my personal website. The project repository is stored in github, so the pipeline was set up using github actions. I already had linting of the code and automated testing on PR configured, and during the course I automated building of the docker container, pushing it to dockerhub, and then pulling in inside the aws lightsail instance using watchtower.

On the linting and testing side, I used python spesific tools: For linting flake8 (Many other linters exist) and for testing pytest (Other popular frameworks include robot and unittest). As python apps do net need to be built, this was skipped.

Previously I had used a self hosted Gitlab instance to house the repository and CI/CD pipeline. After github actions released, I ecided to move both to there and shut down my gitlab instance due to the hassle of maintenance, due to there being no cost for a small project such as mine, and becuase I had no special needs in the testing / building / deploying side of the project githib actions could not handle.

For a solo developer working on small scale projects, I personally don't see much benefit for running your own git server and CI/CD platform. This introduces too much unnecessary complexity and takes away time from development. There is also the risk of hardware failures, which requires you to think about backing up your server.
