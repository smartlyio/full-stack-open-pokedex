Continuous Integration (CI) is important for maintaining a working deployment of code, especially
when working with others in an engineering team.  Each coding language has its own set of popular
tools that are used in the CI process.  In this short essay I will be covering some of the most
popular tools used with Java.  For keeping code clean and maintanable, one of the most popular linters
is Checkstyle.  For building and managing of Java-based projects, Apache Maven is widely used.
For testing, JUnit is a popular testing framework for writing and running tests.  Packaging
the application into containers for portability across environments requires a packager, for which
Docker is a very popular option, even outside of Java.  Finally the code needs to be deployed.  Jenkins
is a great option for deployment after succcessful builds and tests.

Jenkins and GitHub Actions are two popular continuous integration tools for Java platforms.  Other
options besides Jenkins or GitHubActions would be Buddy, which is a self-hosted CI tool, TeamCity,
a free CI made for Java applications, and Bamboo CI, one of the best Java CI tools developed by Atlassian.
Bamboo CI is completely written in Java and supports other languates and technologies such as Maven, Git, SVN.

This setup I suggested in the first paragraph would work in either a cloud-based or self-hosted environment.
A cloud-based environment would have easier scalability, managed services, and integration, while
while sacrificing a bit of security.  A self-hosted environment would be more secure and allow more
customization but would require the user to maintain and update the infrastructure.
