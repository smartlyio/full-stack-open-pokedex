## Exercise 11.1

I choose Java as the language of CI/CD since Java has the infamous ecosystem Spring Boot that is worthy
of investigation later on.

## Answers to the questions:

- Tools for linting, testing and buiding are [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/),
[JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) and [Gradle](https://junit.org/junit5/).
- CircleCI, Travis, TeamCity, etc... However, Jenkins still remain number 1.
- Self-hosted environment, and I definitely use Jenkins.

## Essay

Java is pretty much the defacto language of programming in commercial and business settings, much
the same way COBOL was before the 2000. It has the powerful ecosystem Spring Boot which is
quite the standard of web development in medium to large corporations in Finland in which
people have to deal with legacy codes; it is also used for developments apps to mobile phones,
including Android and iPhones using JVM language.

Given its massive popularity, it is natural to have a CI/CD system tailored to Java, and Jenkins
naturally arrives as the spot number 1. Since my projects are, most of the time, private
and want to use the most technical and necessary, secure parameters possible, there is nothing
that can beat Jenkins compared to its other competitors. For example, Github Actions
is just cloud-based environment with limited configurations and hardware limitations
that are not suitable for large-scale projects and deployments, which are, for most
of the cases, popular in working-life and in start-ups. To make matter worse,
most of the environments other than Jenkins are built for students projects and
less appropriate for a real, demanding project.

Additionally, I love personal configurations. Learning to make configurations and to read
documentations when necessary is necessary to the success of any software developer. Just like
Webpacks, learning to master Jenkins takes time, but in return we get to tailor
the software in anyway we want and potentially expand the software when necessary.
