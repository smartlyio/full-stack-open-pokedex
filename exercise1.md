# CI/CD Application development

Ok so I we are going to build a little bigger project now. We canâ€™t handle it all by ourselves so we need a team working on it. This project will be built with Java and we need to configure CI/CD for this project in order to optimize the workflow.
We choose to program our project in IntelliJ IDEA, because it has many good built-in tools for java. IntelliJ also has a neat way of choosing our build for the project and this time we are going to pick Maven.  For our project we are going to enable checkstyle for formatting to keep the code neat. We will use SonarQube for static code analysis. It checks for errors in the code without executing it. 
Now we need to also pick a CI/CD tool for our project. The tool needs to build, test and deploy the code. We could go with GitHub actions or Jenkins, or we could go with something new. Other popular tools include CircleCI, TeamCity, Bamboo, GitLab and many others. We could also setup the environment ourselves. Setting up the environment is quite a hassle and it would take up a lot of our worktime. We would need to assess how much resources does the project take when it comes to hardware. If it is a simple project we would pick a cloud-based environment and if it is heavy on the resources we would host it ourselves. For now our project seems to be light enough so we are going to pick TeamCity by JetBrains.
