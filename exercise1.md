## Java Sring application

### Linting, Testing and building

The most popular linting tools for Java applications seem to be CheckStyle and FindBugs.

Spring framework includes some support for testing. It has built in support for mocking Objects etc. The most popular testing frameworks for Java seem to be JBehave and JUnit.

Java is ofc a compiled language so anyone who has dabbled with Java, prolly has some experience with build tools. Gradle and Apache Maven seem to be the most popular ones.

### Alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions

To Github Actions: GitLab, BitBucket, Codegiant, SourceForge, Google Cloud Source Repositories and many more.

To Jenkins: Bitrise, Jetbrains, Atlassian Bamboo, BuildMaster, Bitrise etc etc.

### cloud-based vs selfhosted

I imagine cloud-based is the way to go for most applications and should be considered the default options. With bigger or more niche projects self hosted might become necessary or more financially viable.
