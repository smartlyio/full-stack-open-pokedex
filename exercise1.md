It depends on the size of the time: for small teams, I would consider self-hosted solutions since they are more simple to configure and to manage. On the other hand, you cannot creare complex pipeline. While for bigger teams and more "professional" software, I would decide for the cloud solution since you can create complex workflow, you can have a better management of code. Additionally, you can gain some benefits for storing the codebase right after the development and, therfore, check/take a look of the code in after some years.
