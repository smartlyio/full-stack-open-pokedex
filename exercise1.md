# CI Tools for JavaScript/TypeScript:
## Linting:

ESLint: A widely used static analysis tool, especially for linting in JavaScript. It catches inconsistent formatting, styling, and possible errors​​.
Prettier: Focuses on code style and formatting rules, automatically fixing code that doesn't conform to its style guide​​.

## Testing:

1. Jest: A popular JavaScript testing framework, known for its simplicity and support for React applications.
2. Cypress: End to end testing, simple and easy to set up

## Building:

1. Webpack: A static module bundler for JavaScript applications, transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.
2. Babel: A JavaScript compiler that helps in converting ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards-compatible version for older browsers or environments.

# CI Tools for Java:
## Linting:

1. Checkstyle: Analyzes Java code and ensures it adheres to a coding standard.
2. FindBugs/SpotBugs: Examines Java bytecode for potential bugs.

## Testing:

1. JUnit: A unit testing framework for Java programming language.
2. Mockito: A popular mocking framework for unit tests in Java.
3. TestNG: An advanced framework designed to cover a broader range of test categories: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc.

## Building:

1. Apache Maven: Known for its convention over configuration principle​​.

# CI Alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions:
1. GoCD: Focuses on modeling and visualizing complex workflows​​.
2. TeamCity: Known for its extensibility and customization options​​.
3. Bamboo: Integrates well with JIRA software and Bitbucket, offering per-environment permissions​​.
4. Codeship: Allows full control over the design of CI and CD systems​​.
5. CircleCI: Flexible, supporting many languages and environments, with features like optimal caching and parallelism​​.
6. GitLab CI: Part of GitLab and known for its friendly user interface and comprehensive feature set​​.
7. Buddy: Designed for web developers with a clear UI/UX and supports all popular languages and frameworks​​.

# Self-hosted vs. Cloud-based CI Environment:
Deciding between a self-hosted and cloud-based CI environment depends on various factors:

1. Security and Compliance: For projects requiring high security or specific compliance standards, a self-hosted solution might be preferable.
2. Customization and Control: Self-hosted environments offer more customization and control over the build environment.
3. Resource Availability and Costs: Cloud-based solutions can be more cost-effective and less resource-intensive in terms of maintenance and scalability.
4. Team Size and Project Complexity: Smaller teams or less complex projects might benefit more from cloud-based solutions due to their ease of setup and lower overhead.

#### The cloud-based CI environment is more suitable for this application at this moment.
