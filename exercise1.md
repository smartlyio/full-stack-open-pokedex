## CI for Rust

Rust being a relatively new language with constantly changing ecosystem, some of these might not be relevant in the future. At least currently the Rust compiler forces some linting to be done, for example typing, but external linting tools such as Clippy are typically used. As for testing and building, both are by default managed by the standard library and the compiler. The most common compiler/package manager is Cargo, which is similar to npm. There are some alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub actions, for example CircleCI and Travis. All of them support Rust by default or with plug-ins. For Rust both self-hosted and cloud-based environments can be used and will perform well. The notable problem with Rust is that the compile times can be quite long, so if you have to pay for the compilation time, it can get quite expensive with large projects. For large open-source projects GitHub-actions is probably the best, since you can share code and CI is free for public repositories. For Jenkins, there seems to be only a few guides on how to setup Jenkins with Rust, so if you do not know what you are doing, I would not suggest using Jenkins.
