Python project

Tools:
Lint: Pylint, Flake8, mypy
Test: pytest, unittest
Build: PyBuilder

Alternative CI setups: GitLab, AWS CodePipeline

Cloud vs self-hosted:
A small team like the one proposed is probably better off with the cloud setup which is simpler to configure. This might change depending on costs and/or specific hardware requirements of the project.
