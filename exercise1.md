I chose python as the hypothetical language for this exercise. The most popular linter for python seems to be pylint, allthough there are several others to choose from aswell. 
For testing there are again several options. Robot framework is something that I've come across before, other options includes Pytest, TestProject and even Selenium for web applications. Robot framework itself runs on python and thus writing tests for python applications is pretty straightforward.
As python is an interpreted language, the build step does not require a compiler. It seems that python can handle the build step without additional frameworks. Native packages sdist and build can be used to package and build python projects.
There are many CI frameworks available besides jenkins and gitHub actions. Cloud-based services include GitLab CI/CD,  AWS CodePipeline and Azure DevOps. Self-hosted services include Atlassian Bamboo,  TeamCity, GoCD and Drone.io.
For our example scenario a cloud-based solution would seem more suitable. This is because the development team is relatively small and no special requirements are mentioned. This way there would be no need to worry about hardware and softeware maintanence or compatibility issues. Of course, in real life the actuall requirements of the app would need to be considered as cloud-based CI setups may not support every specific need. If, for example GPU based testing is required cloud-based solution might not cut it.
