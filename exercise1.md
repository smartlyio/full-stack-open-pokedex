Linting is the process of checking the source code for programmatic and stylistic errors.
Some of the tools that have been popularly used are amongs other JSLint, JS Hint and ESLint
which we used frequently during this course. I personally like using Indent-Rainbow also because
it help me spot the correct fragments of code and therefore spot bugs or mistakes.

These tests focus on testing the usability and responsiveness of the application, some of the
tools used during the duration of the course were REST for api testing, Jest in order to test
our redenring result and Cypress to do the end-to-end tests, which in my opinion is very user
friendly and easy to understand.There are many others like MochaJS, Jasmine, etc for Javascript
development.

For the building part we have been using Node, React-Dom, React-redux, React-express and GraphQL,
but there many other tools that can be use and is good to know about, like Vue.js, Meteor, Mocha, etc.

some of the alternatives for CI/CD besides Jerkins (which is apparantly getting old since it was
and nowadays doesn't provide all the necessary tools) could be Harness CI, CircleCI, Travis CI and
TeamCity amongs others.

If the setup is self-hosted it bring better control over it, but it also needs a lot more resouces
which aover time are more expensive than the cloud services that nowadays have been offer, many
times those coming with customer support and many other perks that come with a paid service,
so in a long run using cloud services can be at his point in time cheaper and convinient, specially
for newby developers.
