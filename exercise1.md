Language I chose for this exercise is Java. I have basic knowledge of Java but very little knowledge of lint and build options of Java applications. 

There are a couple of ways to lint your Java application. For linting with Java one can use Gradle Wrapper if using androidStudio or Gradle. A standalone tool for linting is android SDK tools. 

For testing Java application, I would use JUnit.  JUnit is part of popular XUnit testing framework. 

For building Java projects there are Ant and Maven. These can be found as build in features in NetBeans. 

An article (https://medium.com/devops-dudes/top-7-best-ci-cd-tools-you-should-get-your-hands-on-in-2020-832c29db936a) by Praful Dhabekar lists top 7 CI/CD applications to use in 2020. This list includes gitLab and Jenkins. Other five are CircleCi, Bamboo, TeamCity (Build using Java), Travis Ci (works with Java) and Buddy. 

In cloud-based solution all is taken care by the service provide. In a self-hosted solution, you pay only for the servers but have to do everything by yourself. This is why I would choose a cloud-based solution for my teams' CI/CD purposes. Then if the application starts to grow or long-term cost would go up, I will switch to self-hosted solution. This way, at the start, my team could concentrate on building the application and not the pipeline.
