Lets consider JS ecosystem.
For lint we can use well known eslint and choose one of the big companies lint ruleset, to unificate developers code. 
For build we we can think of casual Webpack or Vite. Also Rollup and Parcel are possible choices.
For automated testing jest is common choice.
As an alternative we can choose is Node.js CI/CD on Azure, which is cloud-based CI/CD system. Others are Travis, CircleCI and CodeShip. 
Main difference between them is a variety of possibllities that they can offer. For example in Jenkins the is a big plugin system which you can use to shape your project exactly like you want it. In Travis we can utilize automation tooling with Danger.
I suppose that cloud-based solutions beats local-ones in almost all aspects unless your project is aiming to grow big or if you already are working in a big company that can cover all extra expanses on maintaining your localhost.
