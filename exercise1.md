1. Common steps JS/react:
   Uploading to GitHub
   Linting: installation and configuration of ESLint.
   Using Webpack to build production package
   Testing with cypress, including installing dependencies for ESLint

2. Other CI alternatives:
TemCity, Big eval, GoCD, Bamboo, GitLab, circleci for cross-platform apps, Codeship, integrity...

3. Self-hosted or cloud-based environment?
This steps are better in cloud-based (Github) environment since our project is quite small without any special requirements and we already use Github and its much easier to use and its has a minimum learning curve as well as very little configuration to be set..
Github is also very good reputation and is very popular among developers and companies.
