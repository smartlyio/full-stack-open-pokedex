# CI stuff for an application developed in C#

## Introduction:
In this small essay, we will explore the steps involved in setting up a CI pipeline for an application developed in C# (Csharp). Common phases of a CI installation are fluffing, testing, and building. We'll discuss the specific tools available in the C# ecosystem for these steps, explore other alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions for CI setups, and consider the suitability of a self-hosted or cloud-based environment for a CI deployment.

## CI steps and tools in the C# ecosystem:
In linting, tools such as StyleCop and SonarLint can be used to enforce coding conventions, maintain code consistency, and identify potential problems in the codebase.
C# developers often use the built-in MSTest testing framework as well as popular third-party frameworks such as NUnit and xUnit.net for testing. This framework offers a wide range of testing capabilities, including unit testing, integration testing, and behavior-driven development testing (BDD).
For building, the defacto build tool in the C# ecosystem is MSBuild, which is integrated into Visual Studio. Other tools like Cake and FAKE offer more flexibility and automation options for building C# projects.

## Alternatives for Jenkins and GitHub:
In addition to Jenkins and GitHub Actions, there are several options available for CI setup in the C# ecosystem. Azure Pipelines, TeamCity, AppVeyor, and Bamboo are popular options. These tools offer similar functions such as code integration, testing, and deployment, with varying customization and integration options.

## Self-hosted or cloud-based environment:
Deciding between a self-hosted or cloud-based environment for a CI deployment depends on several factors. A self-hosted environment offers more control and customization options, but requires infrastructure and maintenance efforts. It is suitable when there are specific security or compliance requirements or when the team has expertise in infrastructure management.

A cloud-based environment such as Azure Pipelines, AWS CodePipeline or Google Cloud Build offers scalability, flexibility and seamless integration with other cloud services. It eliminates the need to install and maintain infrastructure, allowing the team to focus on development. It is suitable when the team wants to take advantage of cloud resources, achieve faster scalability and reduce operational overheads. To make a decision based on the final selection, factors such as budget, team expertise, project requirements, scalability needs, desired level of control and integration possibilities must be taken into account
