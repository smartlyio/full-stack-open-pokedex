Rust is a modern, powerful, and safe system-level programming language that has gained significant popularity in recent years. There are specific tools in the Rust ecosystem designed to handle various steps of the CI process. Some of these tools include:

Linting: Clippy is a popular linter for Rust, which provides helpful tips and suggestions for improving your code. It can catch common mistakes and enforce best practices to help maintain code quality.

Testing: Rust has built-in support for unit and integration testing through its test framework. The cargo test command is used to run all tests in a Rust project, making it easy to incorporate into a CI pipeline.

Building: Cargo is the official package manager and build tool for Rust. It simplifies the process of compiling and building Rust projects, as well as managing dependencies.

In addition to Jenkins and GitHub Actions, there are several other CI platforms available that can be used to set up CI for Rust projects. Some of these alternatives include:

GitLab CI/CD: GitLab is a popular DevOps platform that provides built-in CI/CD features. It allows you to define custom pipelines, run parallel jobs, and store artefacts.

Travis CI: Travis CI is another widely used CI platform that supports Rust projects. It offers easy integration with GitHub and allows for parallel builds, caching, and customizable build environments.

CircleCI: CircleCI is a cloud-based CI/CD platform that offers support for Rust projects. It provides features like parallelism, caching, and containerization, making it a suitable choice for Rust CI pipelines.

Azure Pipelines: Azure Pipelines is a CI/CD service from Microsoft's Azure cloud platform. It supports Rust projects and offers seamless integration with GitHub and other version control systems. It provides features like parallel builds, caching, and customizable build environments.
